Face Aligment with simple cnn in Keras 

Today there are a lot of excellent face alignment algorithms, but they are too complex to implement, and most of methods based on deep learning don't meet the requirement of real-time, here I introduces an efficient method based on simple convolution neural network, which can realize real-time face feature points detection.
